# 1. Introduction

In many marine spatial planning problems, the goal is not only to meet
representation targets at the lowest possible cost, but also to consider
*how selected areas are arranged in space*. Highly fragmented marine
protected areas can be difficult to manage and enforce. Small, isolated
patches may not support viable populations or key ecological processes,
and solutions that are scattered across space are often hard to explain
to decision-makers and stakeholders.

Two R packages are particularly useful for addressing these challenges
in a marine context.

-   The `oceandatr` package provides a practical way to build realistic,
    analysis-ready marine planning datasets. It allows users to obtain
    marine planning boundaries such as exclusive economic zones or
    high-seas regions, generate planning-unit grids, and access global
    ocean datasets—including bathymetry, geomorphology, seamounts, and
    environmental conditions—that are aligned to those grids. Together,
    these capabilities make it much easier to assemble consistent inputs
    for marine spatial planning analyses.

-   The `minpatch` package is a post-processing tool that modifies
    conservation planning solutions produced by `prioritizr` to reduce
    fragmentation. It enforces a user-defined minimum patch size by
    removing patches that are too small and adding new areas to maintain
    conservation targets. It then simplifies the solution by removing
    unnecessary planning units, while tracking how these changes affect
    patch structure and total cost.

In this vignette, we demonstrate the use of `oceandatr` and `minpatch`
using a simple marine example from the Seychelles Exclusive Economic
Zone. We first use `oceandatr` to construct a gridded planning problem
with a small set of marine features and then solve a standard
`prioritizr` minimum-set problem. We then apply `minpatch` to explore
how different minimum patch sizes and boundary penalties influence
fragmentation, and to assess whether `minpatch` behaves as expected in a
realistic marine planning setting.

# 2. Study region and planning units with oceandatr

## 2.1 Load packages

```{r load-packages, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
# might need to increase timeout as it is a large package
# options(timeout = 9999)
# remotes::install_github("emlab-ucsb/oceandatr")
#install.packages("kableExtra")
library(oceandatr)
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(prioritizr)
library(minpatch)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)
set.seed(123)
# Note: oceandatr requires an up-to-date version of curl for data downloads
# install.packages("curl") 
# packageVersion("curl")

```

## 2.2 Seychelles EEZ as the planning region

We start by using `get_boundary()` from `oceandatr` to obtain the
Seychelles Exclusive Economic zone (EEZ). This defines our marine
planning domain.

```{r planning-domain, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Seychelles_eez <- get_boundary(name = "Seychelles")
# Note: needes to update the packageVersion of curl before this worked

# plot to check we have Seychelles' EEZ
plot(Seychelles_eez[1], 
     col = "lightgreen", 
     main = "Seychelles EEZ", 
     axes = TRUE)

```

## 2.3 Choose an equal-area projection

We reproject the planning region into an equal-area projection to ensure
that area- and distance-based calculations are meaningful.

```{r projection, echo=TRUE}
# use sf::st_bbox to get the bounding box coordinates (in lon/lat)
#sf::st_bbox(Seychelles_eez)

# use projectionwizard.org to choose an equal-area projection, then store as a PROJ string
# https://projectionwizard.org 

projection_Seychelles <- "+proj=laea +lon_0=55 +lat_0=-4.5 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"

# check CRS if needed
# sf::st_crs(projection_Seychelles) 
```

## 2.4 Create a planning-unit grid

We now create a grid over the EEZ. To keep runtime moderate, we use a
fairly coarse resolution. Our units will be in meters.

```{r grid, echo=TRUE}
# check which units to use
# sf::st_crs(projection_Seychelles, 
#           parameters = TRUE)$units_gdal

# grid the planning area
Seychelles_grid <- get_grid(
  boundary   = Seychelles_eez,
  resolution = 30000, # 30,000 just to test the code but a finer resolution can be opted with a more powerful PC    
  crs        = projection_Seychelles)
  #output = "sf_hex"
#)

# project the eez into same projection as grid for plotting
Seychelles_eez_proj <- Seychelles_eez %>%
  sf::st_transform(crs = projection_Seychelles) %>%
  sf::st_geometry()

# plot the grid
terra::plot(Seychelles_grid, 
            col = "gold3", 
            axes = FALSE, 
            legend = FALSE,
            main = "Seychelles spatial grid (30 km)")
plot(Seychelles_eez_proj, 
     add = TRUE, 
     border = "black", 
     lwd = 1)

```

Each *cell* of `Seychelles_grid` is a planning unit. To build a
`prioritizr` problem later, it's useful to have a vector version of the
grid:

```{r pu-polygon, echo=TRUE}
# convert grid to sf polygons as minpatch only works
Seychelles_pu <- Seychelles_grid %>%
  stars::st_as_stars() %>%
  sf::st_as_sf() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    id   = dplyr::row_number(),
    cost = as.numeric(sf::st_area(.)) / 1e6  # cost = area in km²
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-layer)
```

# 3. Building marine features with oceandatr

To keep the example focused, we will use a small set of features
obtained using `oceandatr`:

-   bathymetric depth zones

-   geomorphology - seafloor features (banks, ridges, etc.)

-   knolls

-   seamounts

-   coral habitat

-   environmental zones - clusters of environmental conditions

## 3.1 Prepare feature stack

These layers can easily be obtained using the `get_features` function of
`oceandatr`.

```{r get-features}
#set seed for reproducibility in the get_enviro_zones() sampling to find optimal cluster number
set.seed(500)

feature_set <- get_features(spatial_grid = Seychelles_grid) %>%
  remove_empty_layers()
  
#tidy up feature data names for nicer mapping
names(feature_set) <-  gsub("_", " ", names(feature_set)) %>% stringr::str_to_sentence()
```

## 3.2 Plot features

Here is a visualisation of the features.

```{r visualise-features, fig.width = '8', fig.height='13}
#install.packages("tmap")
library(tmap) #for making nice maps
tm_shape(feature_set) +
  tm_raster(
    col.scale = tm_scale_categorical(
      values = c("grey70", "royalblue"),
      labels = c("Absent", "Present")
    ),
    col.legend = tm_legend(title = "",
                           orientation = "landscape",
                           position = tm_pos("center", "bottom", pos.h = "center"),
                           text.size = 1),
    col.free = FALSE
  ) +
  tm_facets(ncol = 4) +
  tm_shape(Seychelles_eez) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(panel.label.size = 1.5)+
  tmap_options(component.autoscale = TRUE)
```

## 3.3 Converting features to sf object and combining it with the PU grid

As MinPatch only works well with sf objects, we convert this feature
stack into sf. Afterwards, we put features and the grid as one data
table.

```{r features-to-sf}
# Features to sf
features <- feature_set %>%
  stars::st_as_stars() %>% # convert data to sf
  sf::st_as_sf() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number()) %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry()

# Combining 
Seychelles_sf <- Seychelles_pu %>%
  dplyr::left_join(
    as.data.frame(features),
    by = "id"
  )

# store feature column names
feature_set <- names(features) %>%
  dplyr::setdiff("id")
```

# 4. Build and solve a `prioritizr` problem

We now build a simple minimum-set problem using `prioritizr`, with
equal-weight features and a uniform target of 30% for each feature.

```{r build-problem}
# build the problem using sf planning units + feature columns

p_base <-
  prioritizr::problem(
    x              = Seychelles_sf,
    features       = feature_set,
    cost_column    = "cost"
  ) %>%
  add_min_set_objective() %>%
  add_relative_targets(0.30) %>% # 30% of each feature
  add_binary_decisions() %>%
  add_rsymphony_solver(verbose = FALSE) # change this to cbc later

p_base
```

We then solve this baseline problem without any fragmentation controls
and use it as a reference for the MinPatch experiments.

```{r solve-baseline, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# solve the baseline problem
t_base <- system.time({
  s_base <- solve(p_base)
})

# Plot the baseline solution
p_base_plot <- plot_prioritizr(s_base) +
  ggtitle("Baseline (no MinPatch)")

p_base_plot
```

In this baseline solution, we see that the selected planning units are
fragmented and scattered across the planning region. There is no
apparent compact areas, which are theoretically better when it comes to
managing protected areas.

# 5. Set up MinPatch parameters

We define minimum patch sizes relative to the planning units by scaling
the **median PU area** by `multipliers` (5×, 10×, 20×). This makes the
thresholds easy to interpret as “roughly how many planning units per
patch”. We also set a single **`patch_radius`** for all runs, chosen to
represent a neighbourhood of about 10 planning units. This radius
defines the spatial search distance used by MinPatch to identify
neighbouring planning units when forming, expanding, or merging patches.

```{r minpatch-params, echo=TRUE}
# median planning-unit area (m² and km²)
median_pu_area_m2 <- median(st_area(Seychelles_sf))
median_pu_area_km2 <- median_pu_area_m2 / 1e6

# multipliers relative to the median PU area
multipliers <- c(5, 10, 20)

# minimum patch sizes in m² and km²
patch_sizes_m2  <- multipliers * median_pu_area_m2
patch_sizes_km2 <- patch_sizes_m2 / 1e6

# patch radius: roughly a circle that covers ~10 PUs (in meters)
patch_radius <- sqrt(median_pu_area_m2 * 10 / pi)

# summary table
minpatch_param_summary <- tibble::tibble(
  multiplier       = multipliers,
  min_patch_m2     = patch_sizes_m2,
  min_patch_km2    = patch_sizes_km2,
  median_pu_m2     = median_pu_area_m2,
  median_pu_area_km2 = median_pu_area_km2)

# summaries of the different values
cat("\nMinPatch parameters (relative to planning units):\n")

cat("- Median planning unit area:",
    round(median_pu_area_km2, 3), "km^2\n\n")

for (i in seq_along(multipliers)) {
  cat("Multiplier:", multipliers[i], "x median PU area\n")
  cat("  - Minimum patch size:",
      round(patch_sizes_km2[i], 2), "km^2\n")
  cat("  - Corresponds to ≈",
      round(patch_sizes_km2[i] / median_pu_area_km2, 2),
      "planning units\n\n")
}

median_pu_length <- sqrt(median_pu_area_m2)
patch_radius_cells <- patch_radius / median_pu_length

cat("Patch radius used for all runs:\n")
cat("  -", round(patch_radius, 1), "m (≈",
    round(patch_radius / 1000, 2), "km)\n")
cat("  - Corresponds to ≈",
    round(patch_radius_cells, 2),
    "median planning-unit lengths\n")
```

**Notes:**

-   When calculating patch radius, it should be divided by pi. This is
    because we are getting the radius of the circle from the centroid of
    the starting patch when trying to expand patches.

-   Moreover, it would be better for the user to have the option to set
    the actual size of their patch rather than inputting a multiplier.
    This would be useful for the app.

# 6. Run MinPatch for different minimum patch sizes

We now run MinPatch once for each minimum patch factor using the
different multipliers. Each run starts from the same `prioritizr`
solution but applies different constraints on minimum patch size.

```{r min-patch-sizes, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
minpatch_results <- vector("list", length(patch_sizes_m2))
minpatch_times <- numeric(length(patch_sizes_m2))

for (i in seq_along(patch_sizes_m2)) {
  
cat("\n============================================\n")
cat("Running MinPatch with min patch area ~",
    round(patch_sizes_km2[i], 2), "km^2 (",
    multipliers[i], "x median PU)\n")
cat("============================================\n")
  
  # time the MinPatch run
  t_mp <- system.time({
     minpatch_results[[i]] <- run_minpatch(
    prioritizr_problem   = p_base,
    prioritizr_solution  = s_base,
    min_patch_size       = patch_sizes_m2[i],
    patch_radius         = patch_radius,
    boundary_penalty     = 0,
    remove_small_patches = TRUE,
    add_patches          = TRUE,
    whittle_patches      = TRUE,
    verbose              = TRUE
  )
    
  })
 
  # store elapsed time (seconds)
  minpatch_times[i] <- t_mp[["elapsed"]]
}

# name the outputs
names(minpatch_results) <- paste0("minpatch_", multipliers, "x")
names(minpatch_times)   <- paste0("minpatch_", multipliers, "x")
```

# 7. Interpreting MinPatch outcomes

In this section, we interpret how MinPatch modifies the baseline
solution. We compare resulting spatial patterns, patch structure, and
trade-offs between fragmentation and cost.

### 7.1 Selected planning units (baseline vs MinPatch runs)

We start by showing only the selected planning units for the baseline
and each MinPatch run.

```{r minpatch-2x2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
# Helper to extract the solution and ensure a `solution_1` column
get_solution_with_solution1 <- function(x) {
  sol <- x$solution
  extra_cols <- setdiff(names(sol), names(x$planning_units))
  if (!"solution_1" %in% names(sol) && length(extra_cols) >= 1) {
    sol$solution_1 <- sol[[extra_cols[1]]]
  }
  sol
}

# Baseline solution
p_base_plot2 <- plot_prioritizr(s_base) +
  ggtitle("Baseline (no MinPatch)")

library(patchwork)

# MinPatch solution plots
sol_list <- purrr::map(minpatch_results, get_solution_with_solution1)

p_list <- purrr::map2(
  sol_list,
  multipliers,
  ~ plot_prioritizr(.x) +
    ggtitle(paste0("MinPatch: ", .y, "× median PU area"))
)

p_1 <- p_list[[1]]
p_2 <- p_list[[2]]
p_3 <- p_list[[3]]

# baseline plot (rename!)
p_base_plot <- plot_prioritizr(s_base) +
  ggtitle("Baseline (no MinPatch)")

# 2×2 layout:
(p_base_plot | p_1) /
(p_2        | p_3)

```

The baseline solution is highly fragmented, with many small and isolated
selected planning units. As the minimum patch size increases, these
small patches are removed or merged, leading to fewer, larger, and more
spatially coherent patches. Overall, higher MinPatch thresholds produce
a clearer and less fragmented spatial pattern of selected areas.

### 7.2 Group summary table (all runs)

Having examined the spatial solutions, we summarise all runs in a single
table to compare outcomes across different metrics.

```{r minpatch-summary, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)
library(kableExtra)

# helper to extract metrics from compare_solutions() output
get_metric <- function(overall, column, metric) {
  out <- overall[[column]][overall$Metric == metric]
  if (length(out) == 0) NA_real_ else out
}

# ---- MinPatch parameter info ----
median_pu_area_m2  <- median(st_area(Seychelles_sf))

patch_sizes_m2  <- multipliers * median_pu_area_m2
patch_sizes_km2 <- patch_sizes_m2 / 1e6

min_patch_lookup <- tibble::tibble(
  multiplier    = multipliers,
  min_patch_km2 = patch_sizes_km2
)

# ---- Runtime lookup (seconds) ----
# baseline runtime left as NA (add t_base[["elapsed"]] if you want it)
runtime_lookup <- tibble::tibble(
  scenario    = c("Baseline", paste0("MinPatch ×", multipliers)),
  runtime_sec = c(NA_real_, as.numeric(minpatch_times))
)

# ---- Baseline metrics (same "Original" across runs) ----
overall0 <- compare_solutions(minpatch_results[[1]])$overall

baseline_row <- tibble::tibble(
  scenario                 = "Baseline",
  multiplier               = NA_real_,
  min_patch_size_km2       = NA_real_,
  selected_pu              = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Selected Planning Units"),
  total_area_km2           = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Total Area") / 1e6,
  n_patches                = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Number of Patches"),
  valid_patches_ge_min     = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Valid Patches (>= min size)"),
  median_patch_km2         = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Median Patch Size") / 1e6,
  total_pu_cost            = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Planning Unit Cost"),
  boundary_cost            = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Boundary Cost"),
  overall_cost             = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Total Cost")
)

# ---- MinPatch metrics ----
minpatch_rows <- purrr::map2_dfr(minpatch_results, multipliers, ~{
  overall <- compare_solutions(.x)$overall

  tibble::tibble(
    scenario                 = paste0("MinPatch ×", .y),
    multiplier               = .y,
    min_patch_size_km2       = min_patch_lookup$min_patch_km2[min_patch_lookup$multiplier == .y],
    selected_pu              = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Selected Planning Units"),
    total_area_km2           = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Total Area") / 1e6,
    n_patches                = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Number of Patches"),
    valid_patches_ge_min     = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Valid Patches (>= min size)"),
    median_patch_km2         = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Median Patch Size") / 1e6,
    total_pu_cost            = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Planning Unit Cost"),
    boundary_cost            = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Boundary Cost"),
    overall_cost             = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Total Cost")
  )
})

baseline_row  <- baseline_row  %>% mutate(min_patch_size_km2 = as.numeric(min_patch_size_km2))
minpatch_rows <- minpatch_rows %>% mutate(min_patch_size_km2 = as.numeric(min_patch_size_km2))

# ---- Combine and format table ----
solution_summary <- bind_rows(baseline_row, minpatch_rows) %>%
  left_join(runtime_lookup, by = "scenario") %>%
  mutate(
    multiplier = if_else(is.na(multiplier), "-", as.character(multiplier)),
    across(c(selected_pu, n_patches, valid_patches_ge_min), ~ as.integer(round(.x))),
    across(c(min_patch_size_km2, total_area_km2, median_patch_km2), ~ round(.x, 2)),
    across(c(total_pu_cost, boundary_cost, overall_cost), ~ round(.x, 2)),
    runtime_sec = round(runtime_sec, 1)
  ) %>%
  select(
    scenario,
    `Multiplier`                  = multiplier,
    `Minimum patch size (km²)`    = min_patch_size_km2,
    `Selected PUs`                = selected_pu,
    `Total area (km²)`            = total_area_km2,
    `# patches`                   = n_patches,
    `Valid patches (>= min size)` = valid_patches_ge_min,
    `Median patch size (km²)`     = median_patch_km2,
    `Total PU cost`               = total_pu_cost,
    `Boundary cost`               = boundary_cost,
    `Overall cost`                = overall_cost,
    `Runtime (s)`                 = runtime_sec
  )

knitr::kable(solution_summary, format = "html", align = "l") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "left"
  ) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)


```

Across all runs, the number of selected planning units remains broadly
similar, while the number of patches decreases clearly from the baseline
to the 5× multiplier, and then increases steadily as the multiplier
increases. This shows that MinPatch mainly changes the spatial
configuration of the solution rather than causing a substantial increase
or decrease in the total area selected.

At higher multipliers, the solution becomes more constrained. In the 20×
run, no patches meet the minimum patch-size requirement (i.e. there are
no valid patches). This suggests that the algorithm may not be able to
simultaneously satisfy the minimum patch-size constraint and the
conservation targets without allowing patches to fall below the
threshold, as the minimum patch size increases.

We also see that only the 5× run has a median patch size equal to the
minimum patch size. In contrast, for the 10× and 20× runs, the median
patch size falls well below the threshold. This suggests that, at higher
multipliers, MinPatch attempts to enforce the minimum patch-size rule
while still achieving conservation targets, but is unable to do so
consistently across all patches.

**Notes:**

-   The Total PU cost values for the baseline and 5× runs may also be
    incorrect, because they should equal the total area selected given
    that planning-unit cost was defined as area (km²). If Total PU cost
    is wrong, then the overall cost values derived from it will also be
    affected. See notes on the individual summaries.

### 7.3 Change maps (Added / Removed / Retained / No change)

After comparing the different runs, we now examine how planning units
were added, removed, or retained relative to the baseline solution using
`plot_minpatch`. Using this functionm, we create maps that provide a
visual explanation of how MinPatch modifies the solution to enforce
minimum patch sizes and reduce fragmentation.

```{r minpatch-plots, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# Create plots for each minpatch run and arrange them with patchwork
plot_list <- purrr::map2(
  minpatch_results,
  multipliers,
  ~ plot_minpatch(
      .x,
      title = paste0("Patch size x", .y)
    )
)
patchwork::wrap_plots(
  plotlist = plot_list,
  guides   = "collect",
  ncol     = 3
) &
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

Across the three runs, increasing the multiplier leads to a clearer
separation between core planning units that are retained and more
peripheral units that are added or removed. As the minimum patch size
increases, a larger share of the retained planning units corresponds to
core areas that persist across runs, while changes are increasingly
concentrated in the surrounding areas. At higher multipliers, we observe
more turnover, with more planning units being added and removed as
MinPatch restructures the solution to meet the patch-size constraint.
This suggests that higher multipliers enforce stronger spatial
consolidation by stabilising core areas while allowing greater
reconfiguration at the edges.

**Notes:**

-   The plot colors are not that colour-blind friendly.

### 7.4 Patch-labelled maps

Since Section 8.3 shows *where* MinPatch added and removed planning
units, we now zoom in on *how selected planning units cluster into
patches*. In particular, we label each patch and classify it as
**valid** (meets the minimum patch-size rule) or **invalid** (falls
below the threshold). This view makes the spatial definition of a
“patch” explicit and helps interpret the patch statistics in the summary
table (Section 8.2), especially the reported number of patches and the
number of valid patches.

A key point is that patch counts depend on how we define “connected”.
Two common neighbourhood rules are the **rook** and **queen** methods.
Under **rook adjacency**, two planning units are considered connected
only if they share an *edge* (north, south, east, or west). Under
**queen adjacency**, planning units are considered connected if they
share an edge *or a corner* (diagonal contact also counts). In gridded
planning problems, the queen method usually produces *fewer* patches
because diagonal contacts can link otherwise separate clusters.

In this vignette, we use **rook adjacency** to delineate patches. For
management and ecological interpretation, rook-connected patches are
often more defensible because they reflect *contiguous area* (shared
boundary length) rather than corner-touching units that may be connected
only at a single point. This makes the resulting patches more compact

The counts of valid and invalid patches reported earlier should be
interpreted with caution. The patch-labelled maps show between 18 and 27
spatially distinct patches across the multipliers, which matches what is
visually apparent and provides a clearer representation of patch
structure.

As the minimum patch size increases, the proportion of valid patches
decreases, as stricter thresholds make it harder for smaller clusters to
meet the minimum size. As a result, more patches are classified as
invalid even though they remain spatially coherent.

**Notes:**

-   Address how the function computes valid and invalid patches.
    MinPatch should probably document (or enforce) that the
    planning-unit geometries need to be topologically aligned (snapped
    to grid). However, snapping the grid at the very start results in
    evenly patchy baseline solution (does not look natural anymore). The
    selected planning units are equally spaced apart from each other
    like a chess board.

-   We could optionally add a safeguard step (e.g., st_set_precision() /
    snapping) inside initialize_minpatch_data() or before
    calculate_patch_stats().

Given this, we show an updated group summary table showing the old and
the new (correct) number of patches.

### 7.5 Individual summaries (per run)

Here, we show all the individual summaries for all the runs. These
provide a detailed breakdown and comparison of the metrics of each
minimum patch run with the baseline solution, as well as other things
such as feature representation.

```{r minpatch-all-runs, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
for (i in seq_along(minpatch_results)) {

  result <- minpatch_results[[i]]
  factor_val <- multipliers[i]

  cat("\n\n## Scenario: MinPatch with min patch size = ",
      factor_val, " × median PU area\n\n", sep = "")

  # MinPatch summary (if it prints text)
  cat("**MinPatch processing summary**\n\n")
  print_minpatch_summary(result)

  comparison <- compare_solutions(result)

  cat("\n**Overall solution comparison**\n\n")
  knitr::kable(comparison$overall)

  cat("\n**Feature-level area comparison**\n\n")
  knitr::kable(comparison$features)

  cat("\n**Feature change summary**\n\n")
  knitr::kable(comparison$summary)
}
```

**Notes:**

-   The calculation for valid and invalid patches should then again be
    rechecked.

-   How is the planning unit cost calculated for the baseline? And why
    does it differ in every summary table (i.e., table for each
    multiplier)?

-   Add units to Total Area (km2 or m2?)

# 8. Run different boundary penalties

The boundary penalty controls how strongly MinPatch favours spatially
compact patches during the whittling stage. At this step, MinPatch
attempts to remove planning units from the edges of patches while
maintaining conservation targets. Whether a unit can be removed depends
on the trade-off between its planning-unit cost and the change in
boundary cost that would result from its removal.

The boundary penalty scales this trade-off by assigning a cost to
fragmentation: higher values discourage the creation of additional patch
edges and therefore promote more compact solutions. In the Seychelles
example, we explore a small range of boundary penalties to illustrate
how sensitive the whittling process is to boundary costs under a marine
grid with relatively uniform planning-unit areas.

```{r minpatch-boundarypenalties}
# calculate reasonable parameters based on planning unit characteristics
median_area <- median(st_area(Seychelles_sf)) 
min_patch_size <- median_area * 5
patch_radius <- sqrt(median_area * 10/pi)

t3 <- system.time({
 result3 <- run_minpatch(
  prioritizr_problem = p_base,
  prioritizr_solution = s_base,
  min_patch_size = min_patch_size,
  patch_radius = patch_radius,
  boundary_penalty = 0,
  remove_small_patches = TRUE,
  add_patches = TRUE,
  whittle_patches = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
) 
})
cat("result3 runtime (sec):", t3[["elapsed"]], "\n")

t4 <- system.time({
  result4 <- run_minpatch(
  prioritizr_problem = p_base,
  prioritizr_solution = s_base,
  min_patch_size = min_patch_size,
  patch_radius = patch_radius,
  boundary_penalty = 1e-5,
  remove_small_patches = TRUE,
  add_patches = TRUE,
  whittle_patches = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
})
cat("result4 runtime (sec):", t4[["elapsed"]], "\n")

t5 <- system.time({
  result5 <- run_minpatch(
  prioritizr_problem = p_base,
  prioritizr_solution = s_base,
  min_patch_size = min_patch_size,
  patch_radius = patch_radius,
  boundary_penalty = 1e-10, 
  remove_small_patches = TRUE,

```

# 9. Interpreting MinPatch with boundary penalties outcomes

## 9.1 Change maps (Added / Removed / Retained / No change)

Here, we visualise the MinPatch solutions for different boundary penalty
values.

```{r boundary-change-maps}
patchwork::wrap_plots(plot_minpatch(result3, title = "Boundary Penalty: 0"),
                      plot_minpatch(result4, title = "Boundary Penalty: 1e-5"),
                      plot_minpatch(result5, title = "Boundary Penalty: 1e-10"),
                      guides = "collect",
                      ncol = 3) &
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The resulting plots are all identical.

## 9.2 Selected planning units (baseline vs MinPatch runs)

We then check the resulting spatial solutions, but only focusing on the
selected planning units.

```{r boundary-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
# Helper to extract the solution and ensure a `solution_1` column
get_solution_with_solution1 <- function(x) {
  sol <- x$solution
  extra_cols <- setdiff(names(sol), names(x$planning_units))
  if (!"solution_1" %in% names(sol) && length(extra_cols) >= 1) {
    sol$solution_1 <- sol[[extra_cols[1]]]
  }
  sol
}

# Collect the boundary-penalty runs

# list of boundary penalties 
boundary_penalties <- c(0, 1e-5, 1e-10)

# corresponding MinPatch results
boundary_results <- list(result3, result4, result5)

# extract solution objects with a solution_1 column
sol_list <- purrr::map(boundary_results, get_solution_with_solution1)

# Baseline solution plot (keep problem object p_base separate!)
p_base_plot <- plot_prioritizr(s_base) +
  ggtitle("Baseline (no MinPatch)")

# minPatch solutions for different boundary penalties
p_list <- purrr::map2(
  sol_list,
  boundary_penalties,
  ~ plot_prioritizr(.x) +
    ggtitle(paste0("MinPatch: boundary penalty = ", .y))
)

# assuming three boundary-penalty runs
p_1 <- p_list[[1]]
p_2 <- p_list[[2]]
p_3 <- p_list[[3]]

# 2×2 layout: baseline + 3 MinPatch variants
(p_base_plot | p_1) /
(p_2        | p_3)

```

The resulting plots are again all identical.

## 9.3 Group summary table (all runs)

We summarise and compare all the runs using a table.

```{r minpatch-grouptable, echo=TRUE}
# helper to grab one metric from the compare_solutions()$overall table
get_metric <- function(overall, column, metric) {
  out <- overall[[column]][overall$Metric == metric]
  if (length(out) == 0) NA_real_ else out  # safer: return NA if not found
}

# MinPatch results for different boundary penalties
boundary_penalties <- c(0, 1e-5, 1e-10)

minpatch_results_bp <- list(
  result3,
  result4,
  result5
)

# runtimes taken from your system.time() calls
minpatch_runtimes <- list(
  t3[["elapsed"]],
  t4[["elapsed"]],
  t5[["elapsed"]]
)

# baseline metrics from the first comparison (same "Original" across runs)
overall0 <- compare_solutions(minpatch_results_bp[[1]])$overall

baseline_row <- tibble::tibble(
  scenario            = "baseline",
  boundary_penalty    = NA_real_,

  n_patches           = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Number of Patches"),
  valid_patches       = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Valid Patches (>= min size)"),
  median_patch_size   = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Median Patch Size"),
  planning_unit_cost  = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Planning Unit Cost"),
  boundary_cost       = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Boundary Cost"),
  total_cost          = get_metric(overall0, "Original", "Total Cost"),
  runtime_sec         = t_base[["elapsed"]]   # baseline runtime from your code
)

# metrics for each MinPatch run (different boundary penalties)
minpatch_rows <- purrr::pmap_dfr(
  list(
    minpatch_results_bp,
    as.list(boundary_penalties),
    minpatch_runtimes
  ),
  function(res, bp, rt) {
    overall <- compare_solutions(res)$overall
    
    tibble::tibble(
      scenario            = paste0("minpatch_bp", bp),
      boundary_penalty    = bp,
      selected_pu         = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Selected Planning Units"),
      total_area          = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Total Area"),
      n_patches           = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Number of Patches"),
      valid_patches       = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Valid Patches (>= min size)"),
      median_patch_size   = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Median Patch Size"),
      planning_unit_cost  = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Planning Unit Cost"),
      boundary_cost       = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Boundary Cost"),
      total_cost          = get_metric(overall, "MinPatch", "Total Cost"),
      runtime_sec         = rt   # runtime from t3/t4/t5
    )
  }
)

# combine baseline + all MinPatch runs in one table
solution_summary <- dplyr::bind_rows(baseline_row, minpatch_rows)
solution_summary
```

The table shows that increasing the boundary penalty does not alter any
of the reported metrics for this example.

Similarly, the values across the individual summaries are the same.

**Notes:**

-   The boundary penalty does not work within MinPatch, looking at the
    all the metrics in the tables, as well as the resulting spatial
    plots.

-   To raise an issue on the MinPatch repository that the boundary
    penalty is not working.

-   To get involved in writing the package (create a branch and see if I
    can fix the issue).
