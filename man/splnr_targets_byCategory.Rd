\title{Assign Targets by Category}
\usage{
splnr_targets_byCategory(dat, catTarg, catName = "Category")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An \code{sf} object (or data frame) containing the features and their
associated categories. Each row should represent a feature (e.g., a species)
with its attributes, including the category.}

\item{catTarg}{A named numeric vector where names are the categories
(e.g., \code{"Group1"}, \code{"Endangered"}) and values are the corresponding
conservation targets (e.g., \code{0.5}, \code{0.8}).}

\item{catName}{A character string specifying the name of the column in \code{dat}
that contains the category information. Defaults to \code{"Category"}.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object (or data frame) identical to the input \code{dat}, but with an
additional column named \code{target} containing the assigned conservation target
for each feature. Features whose categories are not found in \code{catTarg} will
have \code{NA} in the \code{target} column unless they already have a 'target' column.
}
\description{
The \code{splnr_targets_byCategory()} function assigns conservation targets to
features (e.g., species) based on their assigned categories. This allows for
differentiated conservation goals for different groups of features.
}
\details{
This function is useful in conservation planning when different types of
features (e.g., endangered species, common species, ecosystem types) require
distinct conservation targets. It performs a left join with a provided
named vector (\code{catTarg}) where names correspond to categories in your data
and values are the desired targets.

The \code{dat} input should be an \code{sf} object (or data frame) that contains a
column (\code{catName}) identifying the category for each feature.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'dat_category' is an existing sf object in your package
# with a column named "category" and other feature data.

# Example: Assign targets based on predefined categories
targets_by_group <- splnr_targets_byCategory(
  dat = dat_category, # Assuming dat_category has a 'category' column
  catTarg = c("Group1" = 0.5, "Group2" = 0.2),
  catName = "category"
)
print(targets_by_group)

# Example: Assign targets with a different category column name
dat_alt_cat <- data.frame(Feature = letters[1:5], Type = c("A", "B", "A", "C", "B"))
targets_by_type <- splnr_targets_byCategory(
  dat = dat_alt_cat,
  catTarg = c("A" = 0.7, "B" = 0.4),
  catName = "Type"
)
print(targets_by_type)
}
