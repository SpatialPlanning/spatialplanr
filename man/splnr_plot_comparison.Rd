\title{Plot Solution Comparison}
\usage{
splnr_plot_comparison(
  soln1,
  soln2,
  legendTitle = "Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 1:"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{soln1}{The first \code{prioritizr} solution, expected as an \code{sf} object
with a \code{solution_1} column. This serves as the baseline for comparison.}

\item{soln2}{The second \code{prioritizr} solution, expected as an \code{sf} object
with a \code{solution_1} column. This is the solution being compared against \code{soln1}.}

\item{legendTitle}{A character string for the title of the legend.
Defaults to \code{"Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 1:"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the spatial comparison of the two solutions.
}
\description{
The \code{splnr_plot_comparison()} function spatially visualizes the differences
between two \code{prioritizr} conservation solutions. This helps in understanding
which Planning Units are common, added, or removed between two scenarios.
}
\details{
Conservation planning often involves comparing outputs from different
conservation problems or scenarios. This function facilitates this comparison
by requiring two \code{sf} objects, \code{soln1} and \code{soln2}, each representing a
\code{prioritizr} solution and containing a \code{solution_1} column (binary,
indicating selected vs. not selected).

The function categorizes Planning Units into "Same" (selected in both),
"Added (+)" (selected in \code{soln2} but not \code{soln1}), and "Removed (-)"
(selected in \code{soln1} but not \code{soln2}). It then plots these categories with
distinct colors for clear visualization. The output is a \code{ggplot} object
that can be combined with \code{splnr_gg_add()} for further customization.
