\title{Get Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) from WDPA}
\usage{
splnr_get_MPAs(
  PlanUnits,
  Countries,
  Status = c("Designated", "Established", "Inscribed"),
  Desig = c("National", "Regional", "International", "Not Applicable"),
  Category = c("Ia", "Ib", "II", "III", "IV"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PlanUnits}{An \code{sf} object representing the planning units to be used for intersection.
This object should have a valid CRS defined.}

\item{Countries}{A character vector specifying the countries for which to extract MPAs.
To retrieve all global MPAs, use the value \code{"global"}. Country names should match
those recognized by the WDPA database.}

\item{Status}{A character vector specifying the desired status of protected areas
to include. Defaults to \code{c("Designated", "Established", "Inscribed")}.}

\item{Desig}{A character vector specifying the desired designation types of
protected areas. Defaults to \code{c("National", "Regional", "International", "Not Applicable")}.}

\item{Category}{A character vector specifying the desired IUCN Protected Area
Management Categories. Defaults to \code{c("Ia", "Ib", "II", "III", "IV")}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments that are passed directly to the \code{wdpa_fetch()} function
from the \code{wdpar} package (e.g., \code{verbose = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object. This object contains the planning units, with an
additional \code{wdpa} column (set to 1) for areas that intersect with the
selected MPAs.
}
\description{
This function serves as a wrapper for the \code{wdpar} package, facilitating the
retrieval of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) from the World Database on Protected
Areas (WDPA) and intersecting them with provided planning units.
The result is an \code{sf} object indicating the area of planning units covered by
the selected marine protected areas.
}
\details{
This function leverages the robust capabilities of the \code{wdpar} package by
Jeffrey O. Hanson to access and process WDPA data. It allows filtering of MPAs
based on country, status, designation type, and IUCN category, and then
spatially intersects these MPAs with your defined planning units.

For a comprehensive understanding of the WDPA data fields:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Status}: Refers to the establishment, designation, or proposal
status of a protected area at the time of data submission. Valid options
include "Designated", "Established", "Inscribed", "Proposed", and "Adopted".
\item \strong{Desig} (Designation Type): Categorizes the legal or official
designation of the protected area. Valid options include "National",
"Regional", "International", and "Not Applicable".
\item \strong{Category} (IUCN Protected Area Management Categories): Represents
the IUCN management categories for protected areas. Valid options include
"Ia", "Ib", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "Not Reported", "Not Applicable",
and "Not Assigned".

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'dat_PUs' is an existing sf object of planning units in your package.

# Example: Get MPAs for Australia and intersect with planning units.
dat_mpas <- splnr_get_MPAs(PlanUnits = dat_PUs, Countries = "Australia")

# Example: Get MPAs for multiple countries with specific status and categories.
dat_mpas_specific <- splnr_get_MPAs(
  PlanUnits = dat_PUs,
  Countries = c("Australia", "New Zealand"),
  Status = c("Designated", "Proposed"),
  Category = c("II", "IV")
)

# Example: Visualize the result using ggplot2.
# Assuming 'aust' is an sf object representing Australia's coastline,
# perhaps loaded from rnaturalearth::ne_countries.
aust <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(country = "Australia", returnclass = "sf")

gg <- ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = dat_mpas, ggplot2::aes(fill = wdpa)) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = aust, fill = "grey50") +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Marine Protected Areas in Australia") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
print(gg)
