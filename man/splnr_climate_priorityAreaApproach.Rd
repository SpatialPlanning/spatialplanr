\usage{
splnr_climate_priorityAreaApproach(
  features,
  metric,
  targets,
  direction,
  percentile = 5,
  refugiaTarget = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{An \code{sf} object representing conservation features (e.g., species
distribution data). Each column (excluding geometry) should typically be a
binary representation of a feature's presence (1) or absence (0) in each
Planning Unit.}

\item{metric}{An \code{sf} object containing climate metric information. It must
have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per Planning Unit.}

\item{targets}{A \code{data.frame} with two columns: \code{feature} (character, listing
the original feature names) and \code{target} (numeric, the initial conservation
target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).}

\item{direction}{An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
\item \code{-1}: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
}}

\item{percentile}{A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
determining climate-smart areas. For example, \code{percentile = 5} means the
most climate-smart 5\% of areas (based on \code{direction}) are considered.
This value represents the lower limit of the threshold. Defaults to \code{5}.}

\item{refugiaTarget}{A numeric value (0-1) representing the target proportion
assigned specifically to climate-smart areas (refugia). Defaults to \code{1} (100\%).}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with two components:
\itemize{
\item \code{Features}: An \code{sf} object containing the binary information per
Planning Unit for each feature, now split into \verb{_CS} (climate-smart)
and \verb{_NCS} (non-climate-smart) components. This is ready to be
passed to \code{prioritizr} when creating a conservation problem.
\item \code{Targets}: A \code{data.frame} with the adjusted targets for the
climate-split features. This is also ready for \code{prioritizr}.
}
}
\description{
\code{splnr_climate_priorityAreaApproach()} implements the Climate Priority Area
approach by splitting conservation features into climate-smart (CS) and
non-climate-smart (NCS) components and adjusting their targets accordingly.
This allows conservation planning to prioritize areas with higher climate resilience.
}
\details{
This function orchestrates the steps required for the CPA approach:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Preprocessing:} It calls \code{splnr_climate_priorityArea_preprocess()} to
categorize each feature's occurrences into CS and NCS areas based on a
climate metric and a specified \code{percentile} cutoff.
\item \strong{Target Assignment:} It then calls \code{splnr_climate_priorityArea_assignTargets()}
to calculate and assign new targets for these CS and NCS feature components.
This ensures that conservation goals reflect the desired emphasis on climate-smart
areas (e.g., aiming for 100\% representation of features in highly resilient areas).
}

The output of this function is a list containing the modified features (now
split into CS/NCS components) and their corresponding adjusted targets, ready
to be used in a \code{prioritizr} conservation problem.
