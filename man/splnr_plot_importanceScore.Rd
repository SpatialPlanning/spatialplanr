\usage{
splnr_plot_importanceScore(
  soln,
  pDat,
  method = "Ferrier",
  plotTitle = "",
  colorMap = "A",
  decimals = 4,
  legendTitle = "Importance Score"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{soln}{The \code{prioritizr} solution object, expected as an \code{sf} object.
It should contain a \code{solution_1} column.}

\item{pDat}{The \code{prioritizr} problem object that was solved to generate \code{soln}.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method for calculating importance
scores. Must be one of \code{"Ferrier"}, \code{"RWR"}, or \code{"RC"}. Defaults to \code{"Ferrier"}.}

\item{plotTitle}{A character string for the title of the plot. Defaults to \code{""}.}

\item{colorMap}{A character string indicating the \code{viridis} color map to use
(e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"). See
\url{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html} for all options.
Defaults to \code{"A"}.}

\item{decimals}{The number of decimal places to display for the importance scores
in the legend. Ferrier Score often benefits from a higher number of decimals (>4).
Defaults to \code{4}.}

\item{legendTitle}{A character string for the title of the legend.
Defaults to \code{"Importance Score"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the plot of importance scores.
}
\description{
The \code{splnr_plot_importanceScore()} function visualizes the importance scores
(irreplaceability) of planning units from a \code{prioritizr} conservation problem
using \code{ggplot2}. It supports different methods for calculating importance scores.
}
\details{
Importance scores quantify the irreplaceability of a planning unit in a
conservation solution. This function leverages the \code{prioritizr} package to
calculate and plot three different types of importance scores:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"Ferrier"}: The Ferrier Score, which is applicable only with
the minimum set objective function. It often requires a higher number
of decimals (e.g., >4) for accurate representation.
\item \strong{"RWR"}: Rarity Weighted Richness Score.
\item \strong{"RC"}: Replacement Cost. This method is generally recommended
by the \code{prioritizr} development team for its robustness, but it can be
computationally intensive and take longer, especially for problems with
many planning units or features.
}

The function outputs a \code{ggplot} object that can be combined with the
\code{spatialplanr} function \code{splnr_gg_add()} for further customization.
