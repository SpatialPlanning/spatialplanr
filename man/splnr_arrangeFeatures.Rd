\title{Arrange Features by Spatial Coordinates}
\usage{
splnr_arrangeFeatures(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{An \code{sf} object whose rows are to be sorted.}
}
\value{
A sorted \code{sf} object, with rows ordered primarily by longitude (X)
and secondarily by latitude (Y) of their centroids.
}
\description{
\code{splnr_arrangeFeatures()} sorts the rows of an \code{sf} object based on the
longitude (X) and then latitude (Y) of its centroids. This ensures a
consistent ordering of planning units, which can be important for
reproducibility in some spatial analyses or data processing steps.
}
\details{
This function computes the centroid for each polygon (or point/multipoint)
in the input \code{sf} object. It then extracts the X and Y coordinates of these
centroids and uses them to sort the entire \code{sf} object. The primary sort key
is the longitude (X-coordinate), and the secondary sort key is the latitude
(Y-coordinate).

Sorting can be beneficial for tasks like debugging, comparing data from
different runs, or ensuring deterministic behavior in algorithms that
process spatial units sequentially.
