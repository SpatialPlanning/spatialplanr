\title{Run the Percentile Climate-Smart Approach}
\usage{
splnr_climate_percentileApproach(
  features,
  metric,
  targets,
  direction,
  percentile = 35
)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{An \code{sf} object representing conservation features (e.g., species
distribution data).}

\item{metric}{An \code{sf} object containing climate metric information. It must
have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.}

\item{targets}{A \code{data.frame} with two columns: \code{feature} (character, listing
the original feature names) and \code{target} (numeric, the initial conservation
target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).}

\item{direction}{An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
\item \code{-1}: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
}}

\item{percentile}{A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
determining whether an area is a climate priority area or not. This is applied
\emph{per feature} to its distribution. Defaults to \code{35}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with two components:
\itemize{
\item \code{Features}: An \code{sf} object containing the binary information per
planning unit for each feature, now filtered to include only its
climate-smart occurrences. This is ready to be passed to \code{prioritizr}.
\item \code{Targets}: A \code{data.frame} with the adjusted targets for the
filtered features. This is also ready for \code{prioritizr}.
}
}
\description{
\code{splnr_climate_percentileApproach()} implements the Percentile Approach to
climate-smart conservation planning. This involves filtering features to
their most climate-resilient areas and adjusting their conservation targets
to account for this reduced feature distribution.
}
\details{
This function orchestrates the steps for the Percentile Approach:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Preprocessing:} It calls \code{splnr_climate_percentile_preprocess()} to
identify, for each feature, its occurrences within the most climate-resilient
\code{percentile} of its distribution based on a climate metric. This effectively
"filters" the feature data to only include its climate-smart components.
\item \strong{Target Assignment:} It then calls \code{splnr_climate_percentile_assignTargets()}
to calculate and assign new targets for these filtered features. The targets
are scaled up to ensure that the original conservation goals are still met,
but specifically by selecting areas from the climate-smart portions of the
features' distributions.
}

The output is a list containing the modified features (filtered to their
climate-smart occurrences) and their corresponding adjusted targets, ready
to be used in a \code{prioritizr} conservation problem.
