#' @title Preprocess Feature Data for Climate Priority Area Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function prepares feature data for the Climate Priority Area (CPA)
#' approach. It divides each feature's distribution into "climate-smart" (CS) and
#' "non-climate-smart" (NCS) areas based on a user-defined percentile cutoff for a
#' given climate metric.
#'
#' @details
#' The CPA approach aims to prioritize areas that are both important for
#' biodiversity features and are considered resilient to climate change. This
#' preprocessing step identifies, for each individual feature, which of its
#' occupied planning units fall within the most climate-smart `percentile` of
#' the climate metric.
#'
#' For each feature, the function performs the following steps:
#' 1. Joins the feature data with the climate metric data.
#' 2. Filters to include only planning units where the feature is present.
#' 3. Calculates the specified `percentile` cutoff for the climate metric within
#'    this filtered set of planning units.
#' 4. Creates two new binary columns for each feature:
#'    - `_CS` (Climate-Smart): Indicates planning units where the feature is
#'      present AND the climate metric meets the climate-smart criteria (e.g.,
#'      top 5% for direction 1, bottom 5% for direction -1).
#'    - `_NCS` (Non-Climate-Smart): Indicates planning units where the feature
#'      is present BUT the climate metric does NOT meet the climate-smart criteria.
#'
#' The `direction` parameter is crucial:
#' - `direction = 1`: Higher values of the `metric` indicate more climate-smart
#'   areas (e.g., lower warming rates). The function identifies areas with metric
#'   values greater than or equal to the `(100 - percentile)`th quantile.
#' - `direction = -1`: Lower values of the `metric` indicate more climate-smart
#'   areas (e.g., less acidification). The function identifies areas with metric
#'   values less than or equal to the `percentile`th quantile.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features. Each column
#'   (excluding geometry) should typically be a binary representation of a feature's
#'   presence (1) or absence (0) in each planning unit.
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values for each planning unit.
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining climate-smart areas. For example, `percentile = 5` means the
#'   most climate-smart 5% of areas (based on `direction`) are considered.
#'   This value represents the lower limit of the threshold (e.g., lower 5th
#'   percentile of warming or upper 95th percentile of acidification).
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'   }
#'
#' @return An `sf` dataframe with new columns for each original feature, split
#'   into `_CS` (climate-smart) and `_NCS` (non-climate-smart) areas, indicating
#'   the binary presence (1) or absence (0) of that feature within those climate
#'   categories. This dataframe retains the original geometry.

#' @title Assign Targets for Climate Priority Area Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function calculates and assigns conservation targets for features
#' when using the Climate Priority Area (CPA) approach. It differentiates targets
#' for climate-smart (CS) and non-climate-smart (NCS) areas.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is a core component of the `splnr_climate_priorityAreaApproach()`.
#' It takes the initial targets for each feature and adjusts them based on the
#' proportion of the feature found in climate-smart areas, and a `refugiaTarget`.
#'
#' The logic for target adjustment is as follows:
#' 1. For each feature, it calculates the total number of planning units it occupies.
#' 2. It determines the proportion of the feature's total presence that falls
#'    within climate-smart areas (i.e., `_CS` areas).
#' 3. If this climate-smart proportion is greater than the feature's original target,
#'    the target for the `_CS` component is adjusted proportionally, and the
#'    `_NCS` component's target is set to 0 (meaning all necessary representation
#'    can be met within CS areas).
#' 4. Otherwise, the target for the `_CS` component is set to `refugiaTarget`
#'    (typically 100% or 1), and the remaining part of the original target is
#'    assigned to the `_NCS` component. This ensures that the entire `refugiaTarget`
#'    for the CS portion is met, and any shortfall is covered by NCS areas.
#'
#' The output `data.frame` contains the new adjusted targets for each feature,
#' now split into `_CS` and `_NCS` components.
#'
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing
#'   the original feature names) and `target` (numeric, the conservation target
#'   for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).
#' @param climateSmartDF An `sf` object (or data frame) produced by
#'   `splnr_climate_priorityArea_preprocess()`. This dataframe contains the
#'   original features split into `_CS` and `_NCS` components.
#' @param refugiaTarget A numeric value (0-1) representing the target proportion
#'   assigned specifically to climate-smart areas (refugia). Defaults to `1` (100%).
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, now including
#'   `_CS` and `_NCS` suffixes for each original feature) and `target` (the
#'   newly calculated targets for each climate-split feature).

#' @title Run the Climate Priority Area (CPA) Approach
#'
#' @description
#' `splnr_climate_priorityAreaApproach()` implements the Climate Priority Area
#' approach by splitting conservation features into climate-smart (CS) and
#' non-climate-smart (NCS) components and adjusting their targets accordingly.
#' This allows conservation planning to prioritize areas with higher climate resilience.
#'
#' @details
#' This function orchestrates the steps required for the CPA approach:
#' 1. **Preprocessing:** It calls `splnr_climate_priorityArea_preprocess()` to
#'    categorize each feature's occurrences into CS and NCS areas based on a
#'    climate metric and a specified `percentile` cutoff.
#' 2. **Target Assignment:** It then calls `splnr_climate_priorityArea_assignTargets()`
#'    to calculate and assign new targets for these CS and NCS feature components.
#'    This ensures that conservation goals reflect the desired emphasis on climate-smart
#'    areas (e.g., aiming for 100% representation of features in highly resilient areas).
#'
#' The output of this function is a list containing the modified features (now
#' split into CS/NCS components) and their corresponding adjusted targets, ready
#' to be used in a `prioritizr` conservation problem.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features (e.g., species
#'   distribution data). Each column (excluding geometry) should typically be a
#'   binary representation of a feature's presence (1) or absence (0) in each
#'   planning unit.
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing
#'   the original feature names) and `target` (numeric, the initial conservation
#'   target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'   }
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining climate-smart areas. For example, `percentile = 5` means the
#'   most climate-smart 5% of areas (based on `direction`) are considered.
#'   This value represents the lower limit of the threshold. Defaults to `5`.
#' @param refugiaTarget A numeric value (0-1) representing the target proportion
#'   assigned specifically to climate-smart areas (refugia). Defaults to `1` (100%).
#'
#' @return A `list` with two components:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `Features`: An `sf` object containing the binary information per
#'           planning unit for each feature, now split into `_CS` (climate-smart)
#'           and `_NCS` (non-climate-smart) components. This is ready to be
#'           passed to `prioritizr` when creating a conservation problem.
#'     \item `Targets`: A `data.frame` with the adjusted targets for the
#'           climate-split features. This is also ready for `prioritizr`.

  ##### Feature Approach ####

#' @title Preprocess Data for Feature Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function creates a "climate layer" by identifying the most
#' climate-smart areas across the entire planning region, based on a percentile
#' cutoff for a given climate metric. This layer is then attached to the
#' original features data.
#'
#' @details
#' The Feature Approach to climate-smart conservation aims to prioritize a fixed
#' proportion of the most climate-resilient areas (the `climate_layer`) and
#' ensure that conservation features are represented within this layer.
#'
#' This preprocessing step involves:
#' 1. Identifying the `percentile` cutoff for the global climate `metric` data
#'    (not per feature, as in CPA).
#' 2. Creating a binary `climate_layer` where planning units meeting the
#'    climate-smart criteria are marked as 1, and others as 0.
#' 3. Joining this `climate_layer` back to the original `features` data.
#'
#' The `direction` parameter functions similarly to the CPA approach:
#' - `direction = 1`: Higher values of the `metric` are considered more climate-smart.
#'   The `climate_layer` will include areas with metric values >= the `percentile`th quantile.
#' - `direction = -1`: Lower values of the `metric` are considered more climate-smart.
#'   The `climate_layer` will include areas with metric values <= the `percentile`th quantile.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features.
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining whether an area is a climate priority area or not. This is applied
#'   globally to the `metric` data.
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'   }
#'
#' @return An `sf` dataframe identical to the input `features`, but with an
#'   additional binary column named `climate_layer` indicating which planning
#'   units are considered climate-smart.

#' @title Assign Targets for Feature Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function calculates and assigns conservation targets when using
#' the Feature Approach to climate-smart spatial planning. It adjusts targets
#' to ensure a specified `refugiaTarget` is met within the climate-smart layer.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is a key component of the `splnr_climate_featureApproach()`.
#' It takes the initial conservation targets for features and modifies them
#' by introducing a new target for the `climate_layer` itself.
#'
#' The target for the `climate_layer` is calculated as `refugiaTarget` divided
#' by the proportion of the total planning units that are designated as
#' "climate-smart" (i.e., `sum(climateSmartDF$climate_layer) / nrow(climateSmartDF)`).
#' This effectively scales up the `refugiaTarget` to ensure that when `prioritizr`
#' tries to select `refugiaTarget` proportion of the total planning units for the
#' `climate_layer`, it will actually aim to select that proportion *within* the
#' climate-smart areas.
#'
#' The new `climate_layer` target is then appended to the original feature targets.
#'
#' @param climateSmartDF An `sf` object (or data frame) containing the
#'   `climate_layer` column, typically produced by `splnr_climate_feature_preprocess()`.

#'   of climate-smart areas that should be selected.
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing

#'   target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).

#' @title Run the Feature Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' `splnr_climate_featureApproach()` implements the Feature Approach to
#' climate-smart conservation planning. This involves defining a global
#' "climate-smart" layer and adjusting conservation targets to ensure that
#' a specified proportion of this layer is captured in the solution.
#'
#' @details
#' This function orchestrates the steps for the Feature Approach:
#' 1. **Preprocessing:** It calls `splnr_climate_feature_preprocess()` to
#'    identify a region-wide climate-smart layer based on a percentile cutoff
#'    of the climate metric. This layer is then added as a new binary feature
#'    to your conservation data.
#' 2. **Target Assignment:** It then calls `splnr_climate_feature_assignTargets()`
#'    to calculate and assign new targets. Crucially, a specific `refugiaTarget`
#'    is set for the newly created `climate_layer` feature, ensuring that a
#'    certain proportion of the most climate-resilient areas are included in
#'    the final conservation plan.
#'
#' The output is a list containing the modified features (now including the
#' `climate_layer`) and their corresponding adjusted targets, ready to be used
#' in a `prioritizr` conservation problem.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features (e.g., species
#'   distribution data).
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing
#'   the original feature names) and `target` (numeric, the initial conservation
#'   target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'   }
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining whether an area is a climate priority area or not. This is applied
#'   globally to the `metric` data. Defaults to `35`.
#' @param refugiaTarget A numeric value (0-1) representing the target proportion

#'

  ##### Percentile Approach ####

#' @title Preprocessing for the Percentile Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function filters the distributions of each conservation feature
#' to include only their occurrences within "climate-smart" areas. These areas
#' are defined by a percentile cutoff of a climate metric applied to each
#' feature's distribution.
#'
#' @details
#' The Percentile Approach to climate-smart conservation ensures that a certain
#' proportion of each feature's occurrence within its most climate-resilient
#' habitats is protected. This preprocessing step identifies these areas.
#'
#' For each feature, the function performs the following:
#' 1. Joins the feature data with the climate metric data.
#' 2. Filters to include only planning units where the feature is present.
#' 3. Calculates the `percentile` cutoff for the climate metric *within that
#'    specific feature's distribution*.
#' 4. Creates a new binary column for each feature (`_filtered`) indicating
#'    planning units where the feature is present AND the climate metric meets
#'    the climate-smart criteria (e.g., top 5% for direction 1, bottom 5% for direction -1).
#'    All other planning units for that feature are set to 0 in this new column.
#'
#' The `direction` parameter defines what constitutes "climate-smart":
#' - `direction = 1`: Higher values of the `metric` are more climate-smart.
#'   The function selects areas with metric values greater than or equal to the
#'   `(100 - percentile)`th quantile of the feature's occupied metric values.
#' - `direction = -1`: Lower values of the `metric` are more climate-smart.
#'   The function selects areas with metric values less than or equal to the
#'   `percentile`th quantile of the feature's occupied metric values.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features. Each column
#'   (excluding geometry) should typically be a binary representation of a feature's
#'   presence (1) or absence (0) in each planning unit.
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining whether an area is a climate priority area or not. This is applied
#'   *per feature* to its distribution.
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart.
#'   }
#'

#' @title Assign Targets for Percentile Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' This internal function calculates and assigns conservation targets when using
#' the Percentile Approach to climate-smart spatial planning. It adjusts targets
#' to account for the filtering of feature distributions to only their
#' climate-smart areas.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is a key component of the `splnr_climate_percentileApproach()`.
#' It takes the original conservation targets for features and adjusts them based
#' on how much of each feature's total occurrence was retained after filtering
#' for climate-smart areas in `splnr_climate_percentile_preprocess()`.
#'
#' The target adjustment logic is as follows:
#' 1. Calculates the "original" total number of planning units where each feature is present.
#' 2. Calculates the "filtered" total number of planning units where each feature
#'    is present *within its climate-smart percentile* (from `climateSmartDF`).
#' 3. Determines the `proportion` of the filtered presence relative to the
#'    original presence for each feature (`filtered / original`).
#' 4. The new target for each feature is then calculated by dividing its original
#'    target by this `proportion`. This scales up the target to ensure that the
#'    original conservation goal is still met, but specifically within the
#'    identified climate-smart areas.
#' 5. Targets are capped at `1` (100%) to prevent values greater than 1.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing original conservation features.
#'   This is used to determine the total (unfiltered) presence of each feature.
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing
#'   the original feature names) and `target` (numeric, the initial conservation
#'   target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).
#' @param climateSmartDF An `sf` object (or data frame) produced by
#'   `splnr_climate_percentile_preprocess()`. This dataframe contains the
#'   features filtered to their climate-smart areas.
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, with original
#'   feature names) and `target` (the newly calculated, adjusted targets).

#' @title Run the Percentile Climate-Smart Approach
#'
#' @description
#' `splnr_climate_percentileApproach()` implements the Percentile Approach to
#' climate-smart conservation planning. This involves filtering features to
#' their most climate-resilient areas and adjusting their conservation targets
#' to account for this reduced feature distribution.
#'
#' @details
#' This function orchestrates the steps for the Percentile Approach:
#' 1. **Preprocessing:** It calls `splnr_climate_percentile_preprocess()` to
#'    identify, for each feature, its occurrences within the most climate-resilient
#'    `percentile` of its distribution based on a climate metric. This effectively
#'    "filters" the feature data to only include its climate-smart components.
#' 2. **Target Assignment:** It then calls `splnr_climate_percentile_assignTargets()`
#'    to calculate and assign new targets for these filtered features. The targets
#'    are scaled up to ensure that the original conservation goals are still met,
#'    but specifically by selecting areas from the climate-smart portions of the
#'    features' distributions.
#'
#' The output is a list containing the modified features (filtered to their
#' climate-smart occurrences) and their corresponding adjusted targets, ready
#' to be used in a `prioritizr` conservation problem.
#'
#' @param features An `sf` object representing conservation features (e.g., species
#'   distribution data).
#' @param metric An `sf` object containing climate metric information. It must
#'   have a column named 'metric' with the climate metric values per planning unit.
#' @param targets A `data.frame` with two columns: `feature` (character, listing
#'   the original feature names) and `target` (numeric, the initial conservation
#'   target for each feature as a proportion, e.g., 0.3).
#' @param direction An integer specifying the direction of climate-smartness:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `1`: Higher metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'     \item `-1`: Lower metric values mean more climate-smart areas.
#'   }
#' @param percentile A numeric value (0-100) representing the cutoff threshold for
#'   determining whether an area is a climate priority area or not. This is applied
#'   *per feature* to its distribution. Defaults to `35`.
#'
#' @return A `list` with two components:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `Features`: An `sf` object containing the binary information per
#'           planning unit for each feature, now filtered to include only its
#'           climate-smart occurrences. This is ready to be passed to `prioritizr`.
#'     \item `Targets`: A `data.frame` with the adjusted targets for the
#'           filtered features. This is also ready for `prioritizr`.
